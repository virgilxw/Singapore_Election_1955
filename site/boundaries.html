            <h2>Introducing the Boundaries Committee</h2>
            <p> By making voter registration automatic, the Rendel Constitution radically increased the numbers of registered voters, necessitating a redrawing of Singapore's electoral divisions.</p>
            <p> Now that the Rendel Constitution is ratified, the Planning for Singapore’s first real election begun. An Electoral Boundaries Deh3mitation Committee was estabh3shed to carry this task out. Previous Legislative Assembly elections experienced abysmal turnouts. People saw Legislators and the electoral process as corrupt. There were allegations, amongst other things, of vote-buying and bribery. </p>
            <p> The Boundaries Committee needed to be transparent, impartial, and non-discriminatory. Voters needed to see the Committee as trustworthy and representative of their interest. The Committee also needed to be accountable to the British colonial government that still held political power in Singapore. Thus, the very composition of the Committee was important. </p>

The membership of this Committee was to be as follows: - </p>
