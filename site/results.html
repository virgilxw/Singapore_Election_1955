                <p>The Legislative Assembly Elections of 1955 were Singapore's first elections to feature universal suffrage. Voter turnout was high. The election was closely fought by charismatic and spirited candidates representing a dazzling diversity of political positions and ideologies.</p>
                <p>1955 was the first foray into electoral politics for many of the political titans which will shape Singaporean politics and lead Singapore's fight for independence. Amongst them, David Marshall, Lim Chin Siong, and Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

                <h2>A Singapore of a different age</h2>
                <p>
                    Singapore was a really different place in 1955.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today's Downtown Core was home to 893,600 people. The mass majority of Singapore's population lived in today's Central Planning Distict, bounded roughly from between Tanjong Pagar, Novena, and Queenstown.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Singapore's city was marked by social and economic contrsts. Dockworkers in Tanjong Pagar lived in slums with a population density of over 2 persons per metre square. A few streets away were bungalows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Off the West Coast, 11,700 people still lived in the Southern Islands - even though there already was, in 1955, a Royal Dutch Shell oil depot on Bukom Island.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even Singapore's landscape was different. Changi airport has not yet been reclaimed. Singapore still had a rural countryside, where 19.3% of the population resided. The 100-metre hills that dominated Tampines and Bedok had yet to be lelveled to provide landfill material in Singapore's East Coast.
                </p>
            </span>

            <span id="s9">
                <p>
                    To protect the interest of rural residents, the Electoral Commission divided Singapore into 3 types of electoral divisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Urban voters were disadvantaged. Urban electoral divisions had, on average, twice as many eligible voters than rural electoral divisions As a result, their votes were diluted.
                </p>

                <h2>The Urban Working Class</h2>
                <h5>The New Kingmakers</h5>
                <p>
                    The boundaries of the urban zone were derived from the legal jurisdiction of the City of Singapore. The city's population was predominantly working class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In urban electoral divisions, Left wing parties ran the table. David Marshall's Labour Front won the most seats of any party, winning 10 of the 12 seats in the Urban Area.</p>

                <h5>A Left-wing Revolution</h5>
                <p>
                    The Labour Front did contest 7 other non-Urban electoral divisions, but only won in one of them. But it did not matter; as the party with the most number of seats, the Labour Front was able to form Singapore's first elected government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They did so without the help of non-urban voters. From now on, the only path to political power is through the rowdy mass politics of the urban working class. This new constituency bought with them a new politics - the politics of the Left; of Socialism.
                </p>
                <h5>For the times they are a-changin</h5>
                <p>
                    The victory of the Labour Front - a political party formed only just over a year before - shocked everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More established political parties would never regain political prominence. The British allowed elections expecting it would produce a syncopathic government. Instead, they found a fiery champion of merdeka and social justice.

                <h5>Tanjong Pagar</h5>
                <p>
                    One urban electoral division not won by the Labour Front was Tanjong Pagar, which was won by Lee Kuan Yew. Tanjong Pagar, located right besides the dock, was populated predominantly by dockworkers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dockworkers were exceptionally well organised. Their unique work, the the physical demands of the work, created a work culture and identity. Labour gangs developed into unions. Historians continue to debate whether the dockworker's union was infiltrated and controled by the Malayan Communist Party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By 1955, however, the Malayan Communist Party has been successfully surpressed by the British colonial administration. A new generation of local labour activists rose to take leadership of Singapore's labour movements. They were anti-colonial nationalists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Labour Front did attempt to recruit a young lawyer name Lee Kyuan Yew, but Lee saw more advantage in alliance with people historian C. M. Turnbull dsecribed as "extreme militant radicals".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The People's Action Party was formed as an alliance between the English-education Lee Kuan Yew and this new generation of labour activists. Lee Kuan Yew cut his teeth in politics as a lawyer representing labour unions. Other PAP leaders like Lim Chin Siong, Jamit Singh, and Fong Swee Suan expected Lee Kuan Yew to play a similar role in the PAP, as a fluent English-speaking spokesmen for the far left-wing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lee Kuan Yew won Tanjong Pagar handily, carrying the electoral division with 78.33% of the vote.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Tanjong Pagar is a working class area. No other division has such a high proportion of workers - wage earners, small traders - and such a low proportion of wealthy merchants and landlords living in it. I wanted to represent workers, wage earners and small traders, not wealthy merchants or landlords. So I chose Tanjong Pagar, not Tanglin."

                <h4>The New Suburbs</h4>
                <p>
                    Between the kampungs and the city is a ring of rapidly growing suburbs. These included the privately built estates of Serangoon Gardens and Bradell Heights. Queenstown, Singapore's first HDB estate, had a electoral division named after it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like the suburbs of Western coutnries during the 1950s, these suburbs were predominantly inhabited by educated young, middle-classed, families. Many of these individuals would had spoke English. They will likely had been educated at places like Raffles Institution and CHIJ. Many of these workers would had been working within the civil service of the British colonial administartion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The left-leaning zeitgeist did mean many of suburanites were progressive on social issues. Nevertheless, like their counterparts in the rapidly growing suburbs of Western countries, many of these voters were more conservative than their urban and rural counterparts. The distinguished themselves on the issue of merdeka.
                </p>
                <h4>Not Progressive Enough</h4>
                <p>
                    The Singapore Progressive Party was, before the 1955 elections, the largest and most established political party in Singapore. Happy to associate themselves with the Colonial regime, the Progressives were willing to defer to the British on most the issue of merdeka. Independence is inevitable, but Singapore's independence process must be proceed in a slow but orderly fashion. Economic growth and jobs are at stake. The leaders of the Progressive Party were cut from the class of commercial and professional men who flourished under the colonial regime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Progressive Party were involved in the passing of bills which set up the Central Providence Fund (CPF) and Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT, later HDB) when they held majorities in the Legislative Assembly. In 1955, the Progressives won three of their four Legislative Assembly seats in the Mixed Zone. The party will limp on for a couple more years, before dissapearing into the annals of history.

                <h4>Queenstown</h4>
                <p>
                    Queenstown, named after the newly coronated Queen Elizabeth II, was Singapore's first government-built public housing estate. Located just outside the city, the area around Queenstown was in the midst of rapid development. Here, the contradictions of Singapore's urban rapidisation played out in dramatic fashion. Political parties campaigned on diffused things. Middle-class residents of SIT estates lived side-by-side with residents who lived in Attap houses. Residents of Attap houses were more than 50 per cent of the electorate. They were primarily Chinese, and are predominantly farmers, hawkers, and labourers.

                    The Progressive Party's candidate for the Queenstown electoral division was war heroine Elizabeth Choy. Choy, educated at the English-medium CHIJ, was awarded an Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for gallantry during World War Two. She represented Singapore at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. By 1955, was a stay-at-home mom with three daughters. Invoking her history as a Nominated Member of the Legislative Assembly, she ran a campaign centred on social liberalism. The Singapore Free Press reported:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "I would like to see the enlightened women of Singapore going around all the divisions teaching others about the importance of the vote." Then [Choy] added, "The men, too."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The two other candidates, in contrast, ran on a platform of tennant rights. SIT planned for 70,000 people to live ain and around Queenstown; twice the current population of 35,000. Considered by the government as squatters, many residents of Attap houses were anxious about the prospect of eviction. Many had already been issued "exit notices" to vacate their homes. This was the last chance for them to make their voices here in the political process before development the farms on which their livlihoods depended were paved over.

                    In contrast, SIT residents grumbled about basically the same things which HDB residents grumble about today. White-collored workers who rented apartments in SIT blocks complained that housing was too expensive and that public infrastructure needed improvements.

                <p>
                    The winner of the election, Labour Front's Lee Choon Eng, sidestepped the issue, proclaiming himself "the champion of SIT tenants" while promissing to gcreate a "new chapter" for Attap dwellers.

                <p>
                    A new chapter did begin. In 1959, SIT decided to build Alexandria estate over the area's largest Kampung.
