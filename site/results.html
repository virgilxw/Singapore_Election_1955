                <p>The Legislative Assembly Elections of 1955 were Singapore's first elections to feature universal suffrage. Voter turnout was high. The election was closely fought by charismatic and spirited candidates representing a dazzling diversity of political positions and ideologies.</p>
                <p>1955 was the first foray into electoral politics for many of the political titans which will shape Singaporean politics and lead Singapore's fight for independence. Amongst them, David Marshall, Lim Chin Siong, and Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

                <h2>A Singapore of a different age</h2>
                <p>
                    Singapore was a really different place in 1955.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today's Downtown Core was home to 893,600 people. The mass majority of Singapore's population lived in today's Central Planning Distict, bounded roughly from between Tanjong Pagar, Novena, and Queenstown.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Singapore's city was marked by social and economic contrsts. Dockworkers in Tanjong Pagar lived in slums with a population density of over 2 persons per metre square. A few streets away were bungalows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Off the West Coast, 11,700 people still lived in the Southern Islands - even though there already was, in 1955, a Royal Dutch Shell oil depot on Bukom Island.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even Singapore's landscape was different. Changi airport has not yet been reclaimed. Singapore still had a rural countryside, where 19.3% of the population resided. The 100-metre hills that dominated Tampines and Bedok had yet to be lelveled to provide landfill material in Singapore's East Coast.
                </p>
            </span>

            <span id="s9">
                <p>
                    To protect the interest of rural residents, the Electoral Commission divided Singapore into 3 types of electoral divisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Urban voters were disadvantaged. Urban electoral divisions had, on average, twice as many eligible voters than rural electoral divisions As a result, their votes were diluted.
                </p>

                <h2>The Urban Working Class</h2>
                <h5>The New Kingmakers</h5>
                <p>
                    The boundaries of the urban zone were derived from the legal jurisdiction of the City of Singapore. The city's population was predominantly working class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In urban electoral divisions, Left wing parties ran the table. David Marshall's Labour Front won the most seats of any party, winning 10 of the 12 seats in the Urban Area.</p>

                <h5>A Left-wing Revolution</h5>
                <p>
                    The Labour Front did contest 7 other non-Urban electoral divisions, but failed to win in any of them. But it did not matter; as the party with the most number of seats, the Labour Front was able to form Singapore's first elected government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They did so without the help of non-urban voters. From now on, the only path to political power is through the rowdy mass politics of the urban working class. This new constituency bought with them a new politics - the politics of the Left; of Socialism.
                </p>
                <h5>For the times they are a-changin</h5>
                <p>
                    The victory of the Labour Front - a political party formed only just over a year before - shocked everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More established political parties would never regain political prominence. The British allowed elections expecting it would produce a syncopathic government. Instead, they found a fiery champion of merdeka and social justice.

                <h5>Tanjong Pagar</h5>
                <p>
                    One urban electoral division not won by the Labour Front was Tanjong Pagar, which was won by Lee Kuan Yew. Tanjong Pagar, located right besides the dock, was populated predominantly by dockworkers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dockworkers were exceptionally well organised. Their unique work, the the physical demands of the work, created a work culture and identity. Labour gangs developed into unions. Historians continue to debate whether the dockworker's union was infiltrated and controled by the Malayan Communist Party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By 1955, however, the Malayan Communist Party has been successfully surpressed by the British colonial administration. A new generation of local labour activists rose to take leadership of Singapore's labour movements. They were anti-colonial nationalists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The People's Action Party was formed as an alliance between the English-education Lee Kuan Yew and this new generation of labour activists. Lee Kuan Yew cut his teeth in politics as a lawyer representing labour unions. Other PAP leaders like Lim Chin Siong, Jamit Singh, and Fong Swee Suan expected Lee Kuan Yew to play a similar role in the PAP, as a fluent English-speaking spokesmen for the far left-wing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lee Kuan Yew won Tanjong Pagar handily, carrying the electoral division with 78.33% of the vote.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Tanjong Pagar is a working class area. No other division has such a high proportion of workers - wage earners, small traders - and such a low proportion of wealthy merchants and landlords living in it. I wanted to represent workers, wage earners and small traders, not wealthy merchants or landlords. So I chose Tanjong Pagar, not Tanglin."
