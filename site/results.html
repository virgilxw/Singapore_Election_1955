                <p>The Legislative Assembly Elections of 1955 were Singapore's first elections to feature universal suffrage. Voter turnout was high. The election was closely fought by charismatic and spirited candidates representing a dazzling diversity of political positions and ideologies.</p>
                <p>1955 was the first foray into electoral politics for many of the political titans which will shape Singaporean politics and lead Singapore's fight for independence. Amongst them, David Marshall, Lim Chin Siong, and Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

                <p>To protect the interest of rural residents, the Electoral Commission divided Singapore into 3 types of electoral divisions.</p>
                <p>
                    Urban voters were disadvantaged. Urban electoral divisions had, on average, twice as many eligible voters than rural electoral divisions As a result, their votes were diluted.
