    <p>The Labour Front, however, did not win a majority of the parliamentary seats. This was expected due to the high number of unelected Legislative Assembly seats</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Three “ex-officio” members: British-appointed civil servants from the Colonial Office are Members of the Legislative Assembly by virtue of their post: the Attorney General, Chief Secretary, and Financial Secretary.</li>
        <li>The governor appoints four nominated Members of Legislative Assembly to represent minority and sectoral interests</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Governor John Nicoll accounted for this by pledging ex-officio support for whichever party won the most seats. That, however, only made up 13 of 31 seats.</p>
    <p>The leader of Labour Front, David Marshall, proposed that governor Nicoll give all four non-elect nominated seats to Labour Front cadres. This would give the Labour Front-ex-officio coalition a razor thin legislative assembly of 16 of 31 seats. Nicoll, however, rejected it. Nominated Seats are meant to represent unelected minority interests, not the governing party.</p>
    <p>Under pressure from Governor Nicoll, David Marshall agreed to a coalition with the Singapore chapter of the Malayan Alliance. The Singapore Alliance is the precursor alliance to the Barisan Nasional and is an alliance party between the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Malayan Chinese Association (MCA), and Malay Union. This increased the Labour Front-led coalition to 18 of 31 legislative seats.</p>
