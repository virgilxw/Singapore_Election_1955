			<h2>Welcome to the Singapore of 1955</h2>
			<p>The first public housing estates of Queenstown and Toa Payoh were currently being developed. Most Singaporeans still lived in slum conditions within the city centre, while Singapore still had a rural hinterland consisting of kampungs, plantations, and small scale farms.</p>

			<p>We were still governed by the British. As the dominant political parties in Singapore were sycophantic towards British aims, governor John Nicoll felt that it was safe to permit universal suffrage in Singapore's 1955 elections.</p>

			<p>The elections of 1955 would be the liveliest election in Singapore history. Political party and candidates of all stripes offered their visions of what Singapore's future may be. At what pace should independence be pursued? Socialism or liberalism? Should we merge with Malaysia? Should Singapore fully urbanise or should the countryside be protected?</p>
