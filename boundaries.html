            <p id="abstract"> Now that the Rendel Constitution is ratified, the planning for Singapore’s first real election begun. By making voter registration automatic, the Rendel Constitution radically increased the numbers of registered voters in an attempt to increase turnout. It worked; turnout increased. This, however, also meant this new election needed newly drawn constituencies.</p>

            <h2>Introducing the Boundaries Committee</h2>
            <p> An Electoral Boundaries Delimitation Committee was established to carry this task out. Previous Legislative Assembly elections experienced abysmal turnouts. People saw Legislators and the electoral process as corrupt. There were allegations, amongst other things, of vote-buying and bribery. </p>
            <p> The Boundaries Committee needed to be transparent, impartial, and non-discriminatory. Voters needed to see the Committee as trustworthy and representative of their interest. The Committee also needed to be accountable to the British colonial government that still held political power in Singapore. Thus, the very composition of the Committee was important. </p>
            <h3>Members</h3>
            <p class="blockquote"> Following the cosnideration of [a preliminary report] by the Governor in Council, it was decided to appoint a Boundaries Committee to make definite reccomendations in the light of proposals contained in the Report. The membership of this Committee was to be as follows: - </p>
            <p class="blockquote"> • A British Colonial Officer as Chairman; </p>

                <h2>Community-building Through Election Mapping</h2>
                <p class="">How does a person interact with their community? In a densely populated city, what does it mean to be a member of a constituency if had to cross into another constituency every day to work?</p>
                <p class=""> Historically, these important questions of boundary drawing were determined by the organic evolution of geography and electoral institutions over hundreds of years. Singapore, however, do not have a long history of democracy. Neither do we enjoy a deep culture of democratic interaction.</p>
                <p class=""> The Boundaries Committee needed to draw boundaries in a way which is conducive to the development of political communities where people discussed and debated issues of collective importance.</p>
                <p class="">The Boundaries Commission wanted to preserve the natural centres of communities to the best of their ability. So, they took a rather novel approach:</p>
                <p class="blockquote"> “We tried to look at our proposed divisions through the eyes of the elector and the candidate. The elector should see clearly why he is in one division rather than in another; lines of demarcation, therefore, must be easy to follow. The area should not be bigger than the elector would travel normally and with ease. He must see that he has a common interest with his fellow electors. From the point of view of the candidate, the division must not be too large in number or diverse in interest for him to canvass his electors, or care for his constituents, once elected. He is concerned with the roads and with centres where he can hold meetings.” </p>

                <h2>Axes of Transport</h2>
                <p> Drawing boundaries along the lines of communication and transport was easier done in rural areas, where settlements are generally linearly distributed along major arterial roads.</p>

            <h2>Nucleated Electoral Divisions</h2>
            <p> Electoral boundaries were drawn around pre-identified centres of population. The electoral division of Sembawang was drawn around the Kampung Nee Soon and the settlement located outside Sembawang Naval Base. Ulu Bedok was drawn around Geylang Serai, Jalan Eunos, and Ulu Bedok Village. The Southern Islands, although a scattering of villages, was seen as needs and interests so completely different from the mainland as to warrant a division of their own.  </p>

            <h2>The Urban Rural Question</h2>
            <p> The Singapore of 1955 was still not a city-state. Singapore city had experienced considerable urban growth in the last fifty years but was set to grow even larger. Much of this urban growth was centrally planned by the Singapore Improvement Trust, an institution which would later be renamed as the Housing Development Board. Two new neighbourhoods were in the midst of being built: Queenstown, named after the recently crowned Elizabeth II, and Toa Payoh, which in Hokkien translates to “Big Swamp”. </p>
            <p> Other projects were radically changing the shape of Singapore’s countryside. Paya Lebar Airport, for example, was under construction. </p>
