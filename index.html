                <h2>Community-building Through Election Mapping</h2>
                <p class="sectionTwoText hidden">How does a person interact with their community? In a densely populated city, what does it mean to be a member of a constituency if had to cross into another constituency every day to work? Historically, these important questions of boundary drawing were determined by the organic evolution of geography and electoral institutions over hundreds of years. Singapore, however, do not have a long history of democracy. Neither do we enjoy a deep culture of democratic interaction.</p>
                <p class="sectionTwoText hidden"> The Boundaries Committee were even unable to get accurate figures of where each voter lived; they admitted that much of their predicted electorate sizes were nothing more than educated guesses.</p>
                <p class="sectionTwoText hidden"> The Boundaries Committee needed to draw boundaries in a way which is conducive to the development of political communities where people discussed and debated issues of collective importance. Certain places, by their location, are conducive to becoming community centres. Yet, merely by drawing lines on a map, people are forced to go to different places to carry out their political needs, be it attending rallies or just raising issues to their elected Member of Legislative Assembly. People experience politics differently, with different representatives, candidates. Representatives will champion different issues depending on who is – and who is not – in their constituency.</p>
                <p class="sectionTwoText hidden"> The Boundaries Commission wanted to preserve the natural centres of communities to the best of their ability. So, they took a rather novel approach: </p>
                <blockquote id="twoBlockquote"> “We tried to look at our proposed divisions through the eyes of the elector and the candidate. The elector should see clearly why he is in one division rather than in another; lines of demarcation, therefore, must be easy to follow. The area should not be bigger than the elector would travel normally and with ease. He must see that he has a common interest with his fellow electors. From the point of view of the candidate, the division must not be too large in number or diverse in interest for him to canvass his electors, or care for his constituents, once elected. He is concerned with the roads and with centres where he can hold meetings.” </blockquote>

                <h2>Rural Boundaries: Axes of Transport</h2>
                <p> Figures 3 &amp; 4 are major thoroughfares in the Singapore street network, on an Island-wide and city-centre scale respectively. </p>
                <p>Drawing line along lines of communication and transport was easier done in rural areas, where settlements are generally linearly distributed along major arterial roads. Take the example of the Bukit Timah and Bukit Panjang constituencies. The boundary dividing the two electoral division nicely divides the space between the two main transportation axes – Jurong Road for Bukit Timah and Choa Chu Kang Road for Bukit Panjang.</p>

                <h2>Rural Boundaries: Nucleated Electoral Divisions and Geographical Features</h2>
                <p>Elsewhere in the Rural Kampung-side, electoral boundaries were drawn around pre-identified centres of population. The electoral division of Sembawang was drawn around the Kampung Nee Soon and the settlement located outside Sembawang Naval Base. Ulu Bedok was drawn around Geylang Serai, Jalan Eunos, and Ulu Bedok Village. The Southern Islands, although a scattering of villages, was seen as needs and interests so completely differently from the mainland as to warrant a ward of their own. The Northern Islands, which too few people, was absorbed into Changi. It’s successor, East Coast GRC, is still obnoxiously large in 2019.</p>
                <p>But identifying central points from which to draw Electoral Divisions is only so helpful in identifying where exactly to draw lines on a map. The precise boundaries of Electoral Divisions would be placed on either water bodies that allowed voters and candidates to tell, when on the ground, where one Electoral Division ended and the other started. Rivers proved exceptionally fruitful source of boundaries.</p>
                <p>The Railway and water pipelines were also used as markers.</p>

                <h2>The Urban-Rural question</h2>
                <p> The Singapore of 1955 was still not a city-state. Singapore city had experienced considerable urban growth in the last fifty years but was set to grow even larger. Much of this urban growth was centrally planned by the Singapore Improvement Trust, an institution which would later be renamed as the Housing Development Board. Two new neighbourhoods were in the midst of being built: Queenstown, named after the recently crowned Elizabeth II, and Toa Payoh, which in Hokkien translates to “Big Swamp”. </p>
                <p> Other projects were radically changing the shape of Singapore’s countryside. Paya Lebar Airport, for example, was under construction. </p>
                <p> A drastic attempt was made to protect the interests of Singapore’s kampung dwellers from an encroaching city: </p>
                <blockquote> The number of electors in a division would, however, vary from about 25,000 in densely populated areas to 5,000 in less populated areas. We are anxious to ensure that the rural areas are fully and adequately represented in this new local authority (see paragraph 95 above), and all the more so because we have felt necessarily be resident in the division for which they stand. It is on this account that we envisage considerably smaller divisions in sparsely populated areas. We also recommend that as many divisions as possible should be “mixed”, i.e. partly urban and partly rural in character. The Boundaries Committee agreed with Rendel that if Rural constituencies have as many people as urban constituencies, “the area would be so large that the feeling of community of interest would be dangerously diluted and even the most conscientious candidate would find it difficult to give the constituents the service they have a right to expect. </blockquote>
                <p> The Boundaries committee, however, recognised that giving the average rural voters 5 times more voting power than an urban dweller by putting them in Electoral Divisions with only 5,000 people was a tad bit too undemocratic. They ended up with a compromise:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> 8 Rural Constituencies, with an average population of 32,000.
                    <li> 5 “Mixed” Constituencies, with an average population of 37,000.
                    <li> 12 Urban Constituencies, with an average population of 55,000.
                </ul>
